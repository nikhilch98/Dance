# Healthcheck API and Server Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Server Startup Problems**
- **Problem**: Server was not starting properly and connections were being refused
- **Root Cause**: Missing proper error handling and logging in main.go
- **Solution**: 
  - Added comprehensive logging with proper error handling
  - Improved graceful shutdown handling
  - Added better signal handling for SIGINT/SIGTERM

### 2. **Missing CORS Support**
- **Problem**: No CORS headers were being set, preventing cross-origin requests
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `github.com/gorilla/handlers` dependency
  - Implemented CORS middleware with proper headers
  - Configured to allow all origins, standard methods, and required headers

### 3. **Basic Health Check Response**
- **Problem**: Health check only returned `{"success": true}`
- **Solution**: Enhanced to return comprehensive health information:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "status": "healthy",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-01T08:52:22Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "service": "nachna-server"
  }
  ```

### 4. **Missing Request Logging**
- **Problem**: No visibility into incoming requests
- **Solution**: Added logging middleware that logs all HTTP requests with method, URI, and client IP

### 5. **No Error Handling in JSON Encoding**
- **Problem**: Health check handler didn't handle JSON encoding errors
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling for JSON encoding with HTTP 500 response on failure

## Improvements Added

### 1. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Created `test_health.sh` script that tests:
  - Basic connectivity
  - JSON response structure
  - Response time performance
  - CORS functionality
  - Error handling for invalid endpoints

### 2. **Production-Ready Deployment**
- Created `nachna-go-server.service` systemd service file
- Added proper security settings (NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp, etc.)
- Configured automatic restarts and resource limits

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Created `start_server.sh` script for easy development
- Added comprehensive `README.md` with full documentation
- Included troubleshooting guides and best practices

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful error responses
- Cache-Control headers to prevent caching of health checks

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `github.com/gorilla/handlers` for CORS support
- Updated Go modules with proper version management

### Server Configuration
- **Port**: 8008
- **Timeouts**: Read (15s), Write (15s), Idle (60s)
- **CORS**: All origins, standard methods, Content-Type + Authorization headers
- **Logging**: Request logging with timestamp, method, URI, and client IP

### Security Enhancements
- NoNewPrivileges flag in systemd service
- Private temporary filesystem
- Protected system directories
- Proper user/group isolation

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Health check endpoint reachable
- ✅ JSON structure correct
- ✅ Response time < 10ms
- ✅ CORS OPTIONS request succeeds
- ✅ Invalid endpoints return 404 as expected

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `main.go` - Enhanced logging and error handling
- `handler/init.go` - Added CORS and logging middleware
- `handler/health_check.go` - Enhanced response structure
- `go.mod` - Added handlers dependency

### New Files Created
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `test_health.sh` - Automated testing script
- `start_server.sh` - Developer startup script
- `nachna-go-server.service` - Systemd service file
- `HEALTHCHECK_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Usage

### Development
```bash
./start_server.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
./test_health.sh
```

### Production
```bash
sudo cp nachna-go-server.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable nachna-go-server
sudo systemctl start nachna-go-server
```

The healthcheck API and server are now fully functional, production-ready, and well-documented!
