# Multi-Artist Support Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Dance Workshop application from single artist support to multiple artists per workshop. This includes changes to the database schema, API endpoints, populate script, and Flutter app. **All backward compatibility with the old `artist_id` field has been removed.** The UI now supports displaying multiple artist photos side by side.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server API Changes (`server.py`)

#### Schema Updates
- **WorkshopListItem**: 
  - Changed `artist_id: Optional[str]` to `artist_id_list: Optional[List[str]] = []`
  - Changed `artist_image_url: Optional[HttpUrl]` to `artist_image_urls: Optional[List[Optional[HttpUrl]]] = []`
- **WorkshopSession**: Changed `artist_id: Optional[str]` to `artist_id_list: Optional[List[str]] = []`
- **EventDetails**: Changed `artist_id: Optional[str]` to `artist_id_list: Optional[List[str]] = []`

#### API Payload Updates
- **AssignArtistPayload**: Now accepts:
  - `artist_id_list: List[str]` (list of artist IDs)
  - `artist_name_list: List[str]` (list of artist names)

#### Database Logic Updates
- Updated artist assignment endpoint to join artist names with " X " separator
- Modified missing artist sessions logic to check for empty/missing `artist_id_list`
- Updated database queries to use only `artist_id_list` fields
- Updated `format_workshop_data()` to handle artist_id_list only
- Modified `get_workshops_by_artist()` to search within artist_id_list arrays
- Updated workshop retrieval methods to work with the new schema
- **Updated `get_all_workshops()` to return multiple artist image URLs**
- **Removed all backward compatibility code for old `artist_id` field**

#### Clean Schema
- All database queries now use only `artist_id_list` field
- No more support for the old `artist_id` field
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- **API now returns `artist_image_urls` array instead of single `artist_image_url`**

### 2. Populate Workshop Script (`scripts/populate_workshops.py`)

#### Model Updates
- **EventDetails**: Changed `artist_id: Optional[str]` to `artist_id_list: Optional[List[str]] = []`

#### AI Prompt Updates
- Updated prompt to instruct AI to return `artist_id_list` (array) instead of `artist_id` (string)
- Modified prompt to handle multiple instructors with " X " separator
- Updated JSON schema example to show `artist_id_list` as array of strings

#### Processing Logic
- Updated event processing to handle `artist_id_list` arrays
- Modified missing artist detection to check for empty arrays instead of null values

### 3. Flutter App Changes (`nachna/`)

#### Model Updates (`lib/models/workshop.dart`)
- **WorkshopListItem**: 
  - Changed `artistId` to `artistIdList` (List<String>?)
  - Changed `artistImageUrl` to `artistImageUrls` (List<String?>?)
- **WorkshopSession**: Changed `artistId` to `artistIdList` (List<String>?)
- Regenerated JSON serialization code with `build_runner`

#### Admin Screen Updates (`lib/screens/admin_screen.dart`)
- **Multi-Artist Selection**: Updated artist assignment dialog to support multiple artist selection
- **Checkbox Interface**: Replaced single-select dropdown with multi-select checkbox interface
- **Selected Artists Display**: Added visual indicators for selected artists count
- **API Integration**: Updated `_assignArtistToWorkshop()` method to send arrays of artist IDs and names
- **Success Messages**: Updated to show combined artist names with " X " separator

#### Workshops Screen Updates (`lib/screens/workshops_screen.dart`)
- **Multi-Artist Photo Display**: Added `_buildArtistAvatars()` method to display multiple artist photos
- **Overlapping Avatars**: When multiple artists, shows overlapping circular avatars with white borders
- **Artist Count Indicator**: Shows "+N" indicator when more than 3 artists
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles missing images with colored gradient avatars
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to single or multiple artists automatically

#### UI Improvements
- Added search functionality to filter artists by name
- Visual feedback for selected artists with colored borders
- Dynamic assign button that shows count of selected artists
- Improved dialog layout with proper scrolling and constraints
- **Beautiful overlapping artist avatars with different gradient colors**
- **Smooth transitions between single and multi-artist displays**

### 4. Database Schema Migration

#### New Fields
- `artist_id_list`: Array of artist IDs (replaces single `artist_id`)
- `by`: Combined artist names joined with " X " separator

#### Migration Script
- Created `migrate_artist_id_to_list.py` to handle data migration
- Converts any remaining `artist_id` fields to `artist_id_list` arrays
- Removes the old `artist_id` field completely from all documents
- Includes safety checks and confirmation prompts

### 5. API Endpoints Updated

#### Admin Endpoints
- `PUT /admin/api/workshops/{workshop_uuid}/assign_artist`
  - Now accepts `artist_id_list` and `artist_name_list` arrays
  - Joins artist names with " X " separator in database

#### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/workshops` - Returns `artist_id_list` arrays and `artist_image_urls` arrays
- `GET /api/workshops_by_artist/{artist_id}` - Searches within `artist_id_list` arrays
- `GET /api/workshops_by_studio/{studio_id}` - Returns `artist_id_list` in sessions

### 6. Testing

#### API Testing
- Created `test_multi_artist_api.py` script to verify:
  - Multi-artist assignment functionality
  - API endpoint structure changes
  - Clean schema without old fields
- Created `test_multi_artist_display.py` to verify:
  - New `artist_image_urls` field is returned correctly
  - API endpoints work with new schema

#### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Server starts successfully with new schema
2. ✅ API endpoints return correct `artist_id_list` and `artist_image_urls` structure
3. ✅ Flutter app compiles without errors
4. ✅ Admin interface supports multi-artist selection
5. ✅ All backward compatibility code removed
6. ✅ **Multi-artist photo display works correctly in workshops screen**

## Migration Benefits

1. **Multiple Artists**: Workshops can now have multiple instructors
2. **Better UX**: Improved admin interface with search and multi-select
3. **Clean Schema**: No legacy fields or backward compatibility code
4. **Scalability**: Schema supports any number of artists per workshop
5. **Consistency**: Artist names are properly joined with " X " separator
6. **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase without backward compatibility complexity
7. ****Visual Appeal**: Beautiful overlapping artist photos in workshop listings**
8. ****User Experience**: Clear visual indication of multi-artist workshops**

## UI Features for Multi-Artist Display

### Workshop Cards
- **Single Artist**: Shows one circular avatar (42x42px)
- **Multiple Artists**: Shows overlapping circular avatars (36x36px each)
- **Overlap Effect**: 24px offset between avatars with white borders
- **Count Indicator**: Shows "+N" for more than 3 artists
- **Fallback Avatars**: Colored gradients with initials when images fail to load
- **Different Colors**: Each artist gets a different gradient color for variety

### Visual Design
- White borders around avatars for separation
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Smooth transitions between states
- Responsive to different screen sizes
- Maintains consistent height (42px) regardless of artist count

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Data
1. **Run Migration Script**: Execute `migrate_artist_id_to_list.py` to convert existing data
   ```bash
   python migrate_artist_id_to_list.py --env dev --confirm
   python migrate_artist_id_to_list.py --env prod --confirm
   ```

2. **Verify Migration**: Check that all documents use `artist_id_list` and no `artist_id` fields remain

3. **Deploy New Code**: Deploy the updated server and Flutter app

4. **Test Functionality**: Verify multi-artist assignment and display works correctly
